# DevOps Projects & Experiments Repository

This repository contains all my DevOps projects, experiments, and learning labs.  
It's where I test different tools, technologies, and deployments — everything from Kubernetes to Terraform and AWS services.  
**Note:** This repo is for all my experiments except my separate homelab.

## My objectives with this repository

- Hands-on DevOps practice across multiple technologies
- Build real-world troubleshooting experience
- Practice multi-cloud & multi-architecture deployments
- Learn cloud-native tools like Kubernetes, Docker, Ansible, GitOps, AWS, Ingress controllers, etc.

## What's inside

- **FastAPI Deployment (Kubernetes / Raspberry Pi / EC2)**  
  A simple FastAPI app deployed with Kubernetes, using:
  - PostgreSQL database (StatefulSet)
  - Secrets & ConfigMaps for configuration
  - Ingress for external access
  - Multi-architecture Docker builds

## Next Steps

- Setup Cloudflare Tunnel for secure exposure of local services
- Expand Kubernetes deployment automation (Helm, Kustomize)
